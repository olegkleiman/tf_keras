TensorFlow2 with Keras
CNNs with different models built with Keras on TensorFlow2

## How to build
1. Use Python virtual environment (.venv) 
2. TensorFlow callbacks are served by TensorBoard: $tensorboard --logdir logs/fit. Observe it at http://localhost:6000

## Notes
MNIST datasets are used in this exercises: MNIST digist - a set of handwritten 60.000 digits (28x28 px) for train set and 10.000 digits for test set, MNIST Fashion - images of clothes (same size)
